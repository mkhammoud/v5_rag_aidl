As an AI specialist with some programming knowledge and a limited medical background, you have taken on the task of developing a system using Python and Machine Learning to determine whether a patient is diabetic or not.\n\nTo begin, you need access to the clinic's patient data, which includes information on gender, age, hypertension, heart disease, smoking history, BMI, HbA1c level, blood glucose level, and diabetes status.\n\nAt that time, you told the clinic that you only took Week \\#6 of Programming for Applied AI. Therefore, you decided to split the project into two phases. In the first part of the project, you will address exploring the dataset and extracting statistical information from it. In the second part, you will complete the Diabetes Prediction application and be able to support the patients by telling them whether they are diabetic or not.\n\nYou can find the dataset here: \\texttt{Files/data\\_week6.csv}\n\n\\textbf{Motivation}: In the world of AI and data analysis, the first step to any successful project is to truly understand and explore the dataset at hand. This foundational skill is not only vital for your current course but will serve as the cornerstone for your future data-driven endeavors. So, let's dive in and discover the hidden insights within the data that can lead to meaningful applications and solutions!\n\n\\textbf{Hint}: Make sure to review this week's course content before working on this project, as the questions presented here are covered in this and previous weeks. Also, some questions can be answered in 1 line of code, others might require multiple lines.\n\n\\textbf{Disclaimer}: This project is designed exclusively for the course and should not be used for real medical purposes. AI can make errors and the medical field is highly sensitive. Thus, designing such an application in practice requires a solid knowledge of the medical and AI fields combined.\n\n\n\\subsection*{Phase 1}\n\nUpon downloading the dataset, we have provided a template notebook file to help structure your answers.\n\nThe questions you will address in this phase are as follows:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item Read the dataset using Pandas and store it in a variable. Print the columns of the dataset.\n    \\item Display the first 5 rows of the data in a table format, including column names.\n    \\item Provide an overview of the dataset, including column data types.\n    \\item Present the distribution of genders within the dataset.\n    \\item Show the distribution of smoking history among the patients.\n    \\item Calculate the correlation between the following columns: diabetes, age, BMI, and blood glucose level. Identify which two variables have the highest correlation.\n    \\item To gain insights from the dataset, compute the following statistics: 1) the number of people aged over 50, 2) the count of male patients with diabetes, and 3) the count of female patients who have never smoked and have diabetes.\n    \\item Find the oldest person in the dataset with heart disease.\n    \\item Calculate the percentage of individuals with hypertension.\n    \\item Group and analyze the mean age based on diabetes status and gender.\n    \\item Develop a function named \\texttt{search\\_probability} that takes \\texttt{smoking\\_history} and \\texttt{gender} as parameters and calculates the probability of a person being diabetic or not, based on the dataset.\n    \\item Given information about individuals' ages, diabetes status, and hypertension status, categorize individuals into age groups: 1) Young (age $<$ 30 years), 2) Middle-aged (age between 30 and 60 years, inclusive), and 3) Senior (age $>$ 60 years). Count the individuals in each group based on their diabetes and hypertension status. You can use basic code (loops and conditionals) or Pandas for this task.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\nRemember, there's no only one solution to a problem. A lot of questions above can be solved with different methods. Best of luck!", "metadata": {"source": "./full-course/aai.txt"}}}
