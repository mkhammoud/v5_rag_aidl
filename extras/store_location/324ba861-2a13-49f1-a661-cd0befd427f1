Graded Assessment: Project - Phase 2 (30\\%) [60 mins]}\n\\subsection{Overview}\nIn Phase 1 of the project, You have downloaded the Diabetes Prediction dataset and were able to explore and extract statistical information out of it. In phase 2, we continue exploring the dataset through visualization and performing the necessary pre-processing. We are also going to build a machine learning solution for this dataset.\n\nDon't worry about the Machine Learning aspect (Part 2) of Phase 2. You will be able to work on it after finishing the content of Week 8, where we will learn how to build our first machine learning solution. For this week, you should be working on the visualization and pre-processing exercises.\\\\\n\n% We are dividing phase 2 of the project in two parts: \n% \\begin{enumerate}\n%     \\item Visualization and Pre-processing\n%     \\item Machine Learning\n% \\end{enumerate}\n\n\\textbf{Hint}: Make sure to review this week's course content before working on this part of the project, as the questions presented here are covered in this and previous weeks. Also, some questions can be answered in 1 line of code, others might require multiple lines.\n\n\\subsection*{Phase 2}\n% we have provided a template notebook file to help structure your answers.\n\nThe questions you will address in this phase are as follows:\n\\subsubsection*{Part 1}\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item Plot a histogram showing the distribution for the following features present in the dataset: gender, hypertension, heart\\_disease, smoking\\_history, HbA1c\\_level, and diabetes. You should be plotting a histogram for each of the features.\n    \\item Plot four different histograms showing the combined distribution of the following two features: diabetes and gender, diabetes and hypertension, diabetes and heart disease, and finally diabetes and smoking history.\n    \\item Now, let's study the HbA1c\\_level of the patients:\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item Now let's create a new feature named \"initial\\_diagnosis\" which categorizes the patients based on their HbA1c\\_level. Here is how we can classify them:\n    \\begin{table}[h]\n        \\centering\n        \\begin{tabular}{c|c}\n        HbA1c level\t& initial diagnosis\\\\\n        \\hline\n        $< 5.7$ & Normal \\\\\n        $5.7 \u2013 6.4$ & Prediabetes \\\\\n        $>= 6.5$ & Diabetes\n        \\end{tabular}\n        \\label{tab:my_label}\n    \\end{table}\n    \\item After you have added the initial\\_diagnosis feature to the dataframe, plot three different histograms showing each of the initial\\_diagnosis categories v.s. if the patient is diabetic or not.\n    \\item Drop the \"initial\\_diagnosis\" column you created earlier. We used this column to do some visualization and analysis on the data. We do not need it anymore.\n    \\end{enumerate}\n    \\item Now let's do some pre-processing by encoding the categorical variables. Encode the gender and smoking\\_history columns by applying the one-hot-encoding we learned this week.\n    Once applied, print the head of the dataset and describe the changes applied.\n    \\item Check for duplicates in the dataset and print their sum.\n    \\item If you found any duplicates, drop them and return a new dataframe.\n    \\item Scale all the numeric features using the normalization technique.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\\subsubsection*{Part 2}\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item Divide the dataset into 80\\% training and 20\\% testing\n    \\item Create a logistic regression model in one line using Sklearn then train the model on the training dataset\n    \\item Evaluate the performance of the model on the testing dataset by computing the accuracy\n    \\item Predict if the following patient is diabetic or no:\n    \\begin{itemize}\n        \\item Gender: Female\n        \\item Age: 48\n        \\item hypertension: 0\n        \\item heart\\_disease: 1\n        \\item smoking\\_history: current\n        \\item bmi: 28.4\n        \\item HbA1c\\_level: 6.2\n        \\item blood\\_glucose\\_level: 120\n    \\end{itemize}\n\\end{enumerate}", "metadata": {"source": "./full-course/aai.txt"}}}
