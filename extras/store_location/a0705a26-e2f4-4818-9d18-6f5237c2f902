It helps in creating modular, scalable, and secure AI systems that are easier to develop and maintain. Additionally, as our AI projects grow in complexity, Inheritance becomes increasingly essential for effective software engineering.\n\nWe often work with complex data structures and algorithms. Inheritance allows us to create specialized classes that inherit core functionality, making it easier to build and extend AI models. For example, a base class for a machine learning algorithm can be extended to create specific classifiers or regressors (these concepts will be studied in-depth in future lessons and courses).\n\n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{References}\nFor more information about this topic, I suggest checking the following videos:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSl87lqOXDE", "metadata": {"source": "./full-course/aai.txt"}}}
