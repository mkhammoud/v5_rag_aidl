You may use your editor to run and test your code before providing the results.\n\n\\textbf{Problem 1}- Write a Python code snippet that takes a string as input and calculates the number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in the given string. Your code should be case-insensitive, meaning it should count both uppercase and lowercase vowels.\n\n\\textbf{Expected Output:} For example, if the user inputs the string \"Hello World\", the program should output:\n\\begin{lstlisting}\nNumber of vowels: 3\n\\end{lstlisting}\n\n\n\\textbf{Problem 2}- Write a Python code snippet that prompts the user to enter numbers one by one. The program should keep adding these numbers to a list until the user enters -1. After the user inputs -1, the program should display the list of numbers that were entered, calculate their sum, and then display it.\n\n\\textbf{Expected Output:} For example, if the user inputs the numbers 5, 10, 15, -1, the program should output:\n\\begin{lstlisting}\nList of numbers: [5, 10, 15]\nSum: 30\n\\end{lstlisting}\n\n\n\\textbf{Problem 3}- Write a Python program that takes an integer as input and generates the multiplication table for that number up to a specified range (e.g., up to 10). The program should display the multiplication table for the input number.\n\nYour program should take user input for the number and the range, and then it should generate the multiplication table.\n\n\\textbf{Expected Output:} For example, if the user inputs the number 5 and specifies a range up to 10:\n\\begin{lstlisting}\nEnter the number: 5\nEnter the range: 10\n\\end{lstlisting}\n\nThe program should output the multiplication table for 5 up to 10:\n\n\\begin{lstlisting}\nMultiplication table for 5:\n5 x 1 = 5\n5 x 2 = 10\n5 x 3 = 15\n5 x 4 = 20\n5 x 5 = 25\n5 x 6 = 30\n5 x 7 = 35\n5 x 8 = 40\n5 x 9 = 45\n5 x 10 = 50\n\\end{lstlisting}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\subsubsection*{Guidelines}\n[TO BE ADDED BY LD]", "metadata": {"source": "./full-course/aai.txt"}}}
