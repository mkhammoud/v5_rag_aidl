From this point in this course, we provide examples that are related to building AI applications, through a use case. In addition, we keep providing sometimes simple applications to better illustrate the concepts. The use case introduced in this lesson is based on a dataset (records of data) to predict heart failure based on some characteristics extracted about a wide range of patients. In addition, we provide a Jupyter Notebook that would contain the different examples provided throughout the lessons.\n\n\\subsection{What is a Dataset?}\nA dataset is a structured collection of data that is organized and used for various purposes, including analysis, research, and training machine learning models. It typically consists of a set of data points, each representing a unique observation, and is often presented in tabular form, where rows represent individual instances or examples, and columns represent attributes or features associated with those instances.\n\nDatasets are the foundations for building and training machine learning solutions. The quality and quantity of data in a dataset directly impact the performance and capabilities of AI systems. Machine learning algorithms learn patterns and make predictions based on the information contained in datasets.\n\nNow, let us take a use case for a dataset related to predicting hear failure among patients.\n\n\\subsection{Heart Failure Prediction Dataset}\n\\subsubsection{Problem Statement}\nIn the era of growing medical data and the ascent of Data Science, numerous potential solutions are embracing the challenge of developing predictive indicators for potential diseases. Among these are the cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), which stand out as the leading global cause of mortality, claiming around 17.9 million lives annually and constituting 31\\% of total global deaths. Within the context of CVDs, heart failure emerges as the most occurrent. Individuals with cardiovascular disease, or those at a heightened cardiovascular risk due to factors like hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, or pre-existing conditions, necessitate early identification and intervention. This is where the application of machine learning models can play a very life-saving and imensly important role. By doing so, we aim to build this notebook to automate the resolution of yet another natural problem, leveraging AI techniques to transition our focus towards tackling the subsequent challenges.\n\n\\subsubsection{Dataset Description}\nA dataset contains a set of columns, which we refer to as attributes. An instance of these combined attributes forms a row. Each of these attributes gives us additional information about the patient state, which can help in identifying if the patient possibly has a heart disease. A collection of rows forms that dataset. This data is the core of our machine learning model that we are going to build throughout the lessons. A \"prediction\", which can also be called a \"label\", is the classification of every row referring to a possibility of a heart disease with a yes/no or 0/1.\n\n\\subsubsection{Dataset Attributes}\nIn the attached documents, you can find 'heart.csv', which contains the heart disease dataset.\n\nBelow are the list of columns/attributes in the dataset. We explain the meaning of each of the attributes.\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item Age : age of the patient [years]\n    \\item Sex : sex of the patient [M: Male, F: Female]\n    \\item ChestPainType : chest pain type [TA: Typical Angina, \\item ATA: Atypical Angina, NAP: Non-Anginal Pain, ASY: Asymptomatic]\n    \\item RestingBP : resting blood pressure [mm Hg]\n    \\item Cholesterol : serum cholesterol [mm/dl]\n    \\item FastingBS : fasting blood sugar [1: if FastingBS > 120 mg/dl, 0: otherwise]\n    \\item RestingECG : resting electrocardiogram results [Normal: Normal, ST: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of $>$ 0.05 mV), LVH: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria]\n    \\item MaxHR : maximum heart rate achieved [Numeric value between 60 and 202]\n    \\item ExerciseAngina : exercise-induced angina [Y: Yes, N: No]\n    \\item Oldpeak : oldpeak = ST [Numeric value measured in depression]\n    \\item ST\\_Slope : the slope of the peak exercise ST segment [Up: upsloping, Flat: flat, Down: downsloping]\n    \\item HeartDisease : output class [1: heart disease, 0: Normal]\n\\end{itemize}\n\nBelow is a snapshot of the dataset we are studying.\n\n\\begin{table}[]\n    \\centering\n    \\scalebox{0.6}{\n    \\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c}\n         & Age& Sex& ChestPainType&\tRestingBP&\tCholesterol&\tFastingBS&\tRestingECG&\tMaxHR&\tExerciseAngina&\tOldpeak&\tST\\_Slope&\tHeartDisease\n         \\\\ \n         \\hline\n         \\hline\n         \\textbf{0}&\t40&\tM&\tATA&\t140&\t289&\t0&\tNormal&\t172&\tN&\t0.00&\tUp&\t0\\\\\n         \\hline\n         \\textbf{1}&\t49&\tF&\tNAP&\t160&\t180&\t0&\tNormal&\t156&\tN&\t1.00&\tFlat&\t1\\\\\n         \\hline\n         \\textbf{2}&\t37&\tM&\tATA&\t130&\t283&\t0&\tST&\t98&\tN&\t0.00&\tUp&\t0\\\\\n         \\hline\n         \\textbf{3}&\t48&\tF&\tASY&\t138&\t214&\t0&\tNormal&\t108&\tY&\t1.50&\tFlat&\t1\\\\\n         \\hline\n         \\textbf{4}&\t54&\tM&\tNAP&\t150&\t195&\t0&\tNormal&\t122&\tN&\t0.00&\tUp&\t0\\\\\n    \\end{tabular}}\n    \\caption{Heart Failure Prediction Dataset - A Snapshot}\n    \\label{tab:dataset}\n\\end{table}\n\n\\subsubsection{Jupyter Notebook and Dataset Files}\nUse the below links to navigate to a Jupyter Notebook and a dataset file. The Jupyter notebook contains the necessary information and code to get you started with the Heart Failure Prediction dataset. The notebook has a step-by-step documentation of the presented code. Use this notebook to practice the concepts taught throughout the lessons. Note that for every new concept introduced from this point onwards, you will see it in the notebook, which you can identify by the section number.\n\nIn order to access the dataset, download the 'heart.csv' file and place it in the same directory as the notebook. Open the file and explore its content.\n\nBelow is a short video describing the content of the notebook and the recommended ways for following them.\n\n\\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{Images/video_resource.png}\nTitle: LAU AAI2 W4 L1 Dataset Notebook.MP4.\n\n\\subsection{Conclusion}\nIn this lesson, we introduced the concept of datasets in AI. Furthermore, we described the Heart Failure Prediction Dataset, which contains records of different patients with their characteristics. The goal of this dataset is to associate the remainder of this course with practical example of an application for applied AI. At the end of the course, we are looking to develop together an AI model for this dataset. We also provided a Jupyter Notebook that helps you run the examples that we provide throughout the lessons. \\\\\n\nWhen loading a dataset, it must have a data-structure. This data structure is dependent on the data types and organization of the data. Therefore, in the next lesson, we are going to discover some advanced data structures, including Dictionaries, Tuples, and Sets.", "metadata": {"source": "./full-course/aai.txt"}}}
